# Pomodoro Timer App

This Pomodoro Timer application was developed with AI assistance to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique.

## Features
- Standard Pomodoro timer (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break)
- Customizable timer durations
- Visual and audio notifications
- Simple and intuitive interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows operating system (for the pre-built executable)

## Installation

### Option 1: Using Pre-built Executable (Windows)
1. First, run the build script to generate the executable:
   ```bash
   build.bat
   ```
2. Locate the executable file (`pomodoro.exe`) inside the `dist` folder
3. Double-click to run the application

### Option 2: Running from Source Code
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Clone this repository or download the source code
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Observations
- requirements.txt is only needed to run the build script and it'll run automatically when you run the build.bat file
- The application is a simple GUI application that uses the `tkinter` library
